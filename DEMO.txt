DEMO Mode
============================

By default, RCHub starts in DEMO mode -- output is limited to 4 channels.
RCHub in DEMO mode is fully functional and lets you test compatibility with your hardware.
The number of channels is the only limitation.
For some, 4 channels may be enough, feel free to use RCHub in DEMO mode for as long as you need.

To unlock all 16 channels, please contact us (see README.txt) and we help you activate your RCHub.
