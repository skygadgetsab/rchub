# RCHub Do-It-Yourself Guide (Geekworm X306 UPS Shield)

This guide shall help you assemble your very own RCHub based on Geekworm X306 UPS Shield.

Start with BOM.txt, it contains list of all parts you need to build an exact copy of the fully assembled RCHub available on our shop.
You don't have to make an exact copy, though. The RCHub firmware shall run on any modern Raspberry Pi (3, 3B, 4, Zero 2W).
The only requrement is Waveshare 1.44inch LCD Display Hat -- you need it to see runtime state of RCHub and be able to configure it.
We also recommend you use A1 or A2 rated microSD card.

3D printed enclosure (see STL folder) is optimized for X306 UPS Shield, USB adapters, 3.5mm Audio Socket and a main switch, all listed in BOM.txt
So, print the enclosure and having all parts from BOM.txt list proceed to assembly.

WIRING.pdf and ASSEMBLY.txt shall help you assemble RCHub and install firmware on SD Card.

Consult USER_MANUAL.pdf to learn how to use RCHub.

By default, RChub starts in DEMO mode (limited to 4 output channels), and need to be activated to unlock all 16 output channels.
Please, read DEMO.txt and contact us, so we can help you unlock your device.

Good luck, have fun printing and assembling your very own RCHub! 
Enjoy flying or driving your RC model with an USB controller.
