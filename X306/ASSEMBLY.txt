Assembly
============================

3D Print the Enclosure
----------------------------

Nozzle: 0.2 to 0.4
Layer height: 0.1 to 0.2
Supports: no
Material: PLA, PETG or ABS

Please calibrate your printer to ensure dimensional accuracy before printing.  
Properly calibrated printer also helps you avoid most of post-processing.

Print all parts in STL folder. You'll need 4 (four) pieces of Display Standoff 8mm.  


Hardware
----------------------------

For successful assembly, you need all hardware parts listed in the Bill of Materials, see BOM.txt

Source them or analogs at your favourite shop; Amazon usually has them all.

For the wiring and assembly tips, see WIRING.pdf


Firmware
----------------------------

Do not have RCHub SD Card Image? Download it here: https://skygadgets.shop/products/rchub-sd-card-image

Flash downloaded RCHub SD Card Image to MicroSD Card with help of Raspberry Pi Imager (or analog).
https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

IMPORTANT!
Simply copying over the image file to the SD Card will not work, the image need to be flashed.

Insert the SD Card to the RCHub and power it on. The very first time may take a bit of time, 
please be patient and do not switch the device off.
The RCHub is fully initialised when you see the channels page after RCHub boot screen.
Now it is safe to power off.

See USER_MANUAL.pdf for further instructions.

An alternative to the RCHub SD Card Image is to run freely avaialble RCHub binary on any manually configured Raspberry Pi.
Download the binary from GitHub here: https://github.com/skygadgetsab/rchub


Unlock full functionality
----------------------------

By default, RCHub starts in DEMO mode -- output is limited to 4 channels.
Otherwise it is a fully functional mode that lets you test compatibility of your hardware with RCHub.
For some, 4 channels may be enough, feel free to use RCHub in DEMO mode for as long as you need.

To unlock all 16 channels, please contact us (see README.txt) and we help you activate your RCHub.

See DEMO.txt for more information.
