# RCHub: USB-to-PPM converter with Bluetooth

Use RCHub to control your plane with a stick or H.O.T.A.S., your car with USB steering wheel and pedals, your mini-quad with a game console controller!

**Up to 8 joysticks** simultaneously. (You'll need a separate USB hub for that, as RCHub has one USB port.)

**Up to 16 output channels** configurable directly via built-in interface, no config file editing needed.

Recognizes and pre-configures any new USB controller.

Automatically connects to devices that support Bluetooth PARA trainer protocol and allows you to mix in these channels to PPM output. As such, RCHub can be used as Bluetooth-to-PPM bridge for radios w/o bluetooth support. Especially convenient when used with wireless&nbsp;head trackers, with or without USB joystick.&nbsp;

Processing adds minimal delay -- just half of the PPM frame, or approximately 10ms.

Simple firmware upgrades -- download a new version and place the file on included SD card.

Fully autonomous and provides power to connected joysticks.

Accepts well known and widely used **18650 Li-ion battery** (not included due to shipping restrictions).  
Battery is optional as RCHub can be powered via USB-C from a power bank or a phone charger.
